# OGS
Open Geospatial Server

This project aims to create a fully functional gis server package, with both server and client side packages.
Implementation will require little to know programming knowledge, as the goal is to have all features ready to
go out of the box.

The initial project will be ready for an alpha release in Q2 2017.

Initial Packages will include:
* A geoprocessing package that allows users to publish geoprocessing tasks to be used in web applications
* A mapping package with the ability to quickly serve and cache data (geojson and wms tiles)
* A user interface for creating services, web maps, and publishing geoprocessing services.

With minimal exceptions:
* All server side packages will be coded in python.
* All client side will be the standard javascript, html, and css.
